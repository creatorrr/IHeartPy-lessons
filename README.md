# IHeartPy Raw Lessons

**IHeartPy** - _An interactive python tutor that runs from your browser._

## Description

### What?
* Raw AIML Lessons for IHeartPy platform.
* Now anyone can make lessons interactive.

### Why?
* Lessons are completely separate from the frontend logic.
* Interactivity baked right into the application.
* So I could create any thing interactive. (Imagine interactive comics or comics that talk to you and even teach you. Woah!)

### How?
* Lessons run atop IHeartPy parser.
* Using AIML for something real. (Not another shitty chatbot that doesn't make sense)

* * *

## Instructions

### AIML
* Take look at _Elements of AIML.pdf_ to get a hang of AIML.
* Open up _self-test.aiml_ for a shitty example.

### Creating Lessons
* [Fork this repo](https://github.com/creatorrr/IHeartPy-lessons)
* Learn Python. ( If you don't know already. :P )
* Take a look at _lesson1.aiml_ (It's pretty simple, actually.)
* See how it works at [IHeartPy!](http://iheartpy.com)
* Fool around, share your insights and try things.
* That's it (Yay!)

### Submitting Lessons
* Just send me a pull request.
* I'll add it to iheartpy.com
